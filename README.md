# ITMD362Project2

I feel that my time management was not nearly as good as it could have been. In addition, I believe I took too much charge on the project and had the backfire result of having most of the work put on me in the end, as indicated by the disproportionate amount of commits on my end versus the rest of the group. I also failed to fix the very minor validation errors in the project before the first turn-in point, costing the entire team 5 points on that part out of 10 (which is not fair for what the problems were, but I have to accept the strange methodologies employed).

Comments on group members

Bohdan: 

Bohdan contributed sporadically, but when he did, it was valuable and helped push the project forward. For instance, he put together basic filler material to put on the Welcome page. He also initially created a skeleton for the website. While his initial contributions were only somewhat used in the final project, his input was valuable.

Jimmy:

Jimmy contributed to the group and made changes to files if asked. His work schedule prevented him from working on the project as often as would have been appreciated. However, he contributed by creating our site's login page in terms of html and css. 

Vinny:

Vinny made promises that were not kept and trying to get a notable contribution out of him was a struggle. He was very responsive to group messages and was timely in doing so, but physical contributions to the project were lacking to nonexistent.
